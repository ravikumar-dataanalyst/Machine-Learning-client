Combine the train and test datasets (By Coding), and then develop the following:

1.  At Least three univariate plots.

2.  At least three bivariate plots.

3.  A descriptive stat.

4.  A heatmap to show the correlation among the features.

5.  A missing values plot/summary that shows which feature(s) has missing values.

6.  At least two plots to prove/disprove if the "Flight Distance" feature has any outliers.

7.  At least one plot/summary to prove/disprove if the "Arrival or Departure Delay in Minutes" has extreme delays.

8.  Using plot/summary, prove/disprove that the majority of passengers voted that the trip timing were convenient. Use the rating of "Departure/Arrival Time Convenient" feature.

9.  Suggest data cleaning steps based on your findings, or you could say the data is clean, then you need to explain why. 

10.  Use the train.csv file only to build and train a decision tree classifier to predict customer satisfaction. This feature has two different values which are "neutral or dissatisfied" and "satisfied". 
Use the test.csv file to test your classifier.

11.  Print the values of precision, recall, and f1-score.
